## Project Objectives
We are building a code evaluator that can take input from the user as follows:

- Task description.
- Code (solution).
  
The output should be the following:

- Is this code solving the task description? And if not, how close is this code to the task description?
- Is this code modularized?
- How efficient is this code from the performance, clean code, and readability perspective?
- I need make sure that the code contains the main concepts like Preprocessing, splitting the data, training the model, testing the model, and any other section you see suitable.
- Ensure that the code is AI-generated.

## Usage
To use the Code Evaluator, follow these steps:
1. Input the task description and the code solution into the corresponding text areas.
2. Click the "Evaluate Code" button to obtain assessments in various aspects.
3. Review the results provided for each evaluation case.
